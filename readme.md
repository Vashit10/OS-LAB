# Xv6 Operating System LAB

##📘 Overview
This repository contains lab work for the **Operating Systems Course**, focusing on hands-on learning of core OS concepts using the **Xv6** teaching operating system.

Each assignment explores foundational OS principles such as:
- Process creation, scheduling, and management  
- System call implementation and kernel-user communication  
- Memory management and paging  
- File system operations and I/O handling  
- Synchronization and concurrency mechanisms  

All experiments are conducted within the **Xv6** environment, compiled and executed using **QEMU**.
